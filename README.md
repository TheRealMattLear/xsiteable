xSiteable
=========

xSiteable is a PHP event-based framework for application development. It uses a normalised Topic Maps datamodel 
for super-stable application state through development iterations, and a host of things to make the developers 
life seem easier and cooler. It's a complete plugin system, it comes with widgets, it uses Jquery and Jquery UI
and the cool Boilerplate HTML template framework on the GUI side of things, it is completely RESTful (which 
means that there is no difference between making an application and making an API; the two are the same), and
it sports an easy model for data management, output management and deployment, a really funky access control
system (based on REST structures), and a fully typed backend system, sporting an on-the-fly ontology middle-
layer. If this last sentence means nothing to you; how cool is that?! You get to play with something funky as
well as normal development stuff!

Enjoy. And join in. It will never be complete, never be perfect, never be done; it will evolve and mutate into
what I hope is the perfect development framework that's for people who are sick of the fragmented approach to
PHP libraries.
