            <b>Note:</b> If you're pasting in content from somewhere else (like an email or document), note that there is
            a lot of invisible formatting that often comes with the copy and paste process that will possibly prevent your content to be created properly (or at all), so make sure
            you clean it before pasting it in. The easiest way is to open Notepad, paste your content into
            it, and then mark and copy the text from Notepad and <b>then</b> copy it in here. This will
            make sure the content is cleaned up, and from here you can format the text as you will.
